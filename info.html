  <h1>Engineering Fields of Study</h1>
  <h2>Electrical Engineering</h2>
  <p>Electrical engineering is an engineering discipline concerned with the study, design, and application of equipment, devices, and systems which use electricity, electronics, and electromagnetism.</p>
  <h2>Mechanical Engineering</h2>
  <p>Mechanical engineering is the study of physical machines that may involve force and movement. It is an engineering branch that combines engineering physics and mathematics principles with materials science, to design, analyze, manufacture, and maintain mechanical systems.</p>
  <h2>Aerospace Engineering</h2>
  <p>Aerospace engineers evaluate designs to see that the products meet engineering principles. Aerospace engineers design, develop, and test aircraft, spacecraft, satellites, and missiles. In addition, they create and test prototypes to make sure that they function according to design.</p>
  <h2>Civil Engineering</h2>
  <p>Civil engineers design major transportation projects. Civil engineers plan, design, and supervise the construction and maintenance of building and infrastructure projects. These projects may include facilities, bridges, roads, tunnels, and water and sewage systems.</p>
  <h2>Chemical Engineering</h2>
  <p>Chemical engineers develop and design chemical manufacturing processes. Chemical engineers apply the principles of chemistry, physics, and engineering to design equipment and processes for manufacturing products such as gasoline, detergents, and paper.</p>
